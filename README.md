## About
This project was born out of my interest for the Crypto world and my desire to practice and learn more about frontend development, specifically the framework - React, state management library - Redux and component library - Material UI. I was fortunate to chance upon [Cryptospaces](https://cryptoscapes.org/), a Crypto Dashboard developed by Leonard Tng which served as an inspiration and reference for the development of Gimme the Crypts. 

## Contents
Gimme the Crypts has 7 main pages as listed below
 1. Overview - Top Level Market Data for all supported Cryptocurrencies (Market Cap, Trending Coins, Dominant Coins, ETH gas Price etc.)
 2. Correlation - Correlation values between the Top 50 Coins by Market Cap presented in a HeatMap
 3. Currency - Currency conversion between the top 250 Coins
 4. Coins - List of all supported Coins presented with its corresponding data
 5. Exchanges - List of all supported Exchanges presented with its corresponding data
 6. Defi - Top level Market Data for the entire Defi Space across multiple chains and the list of all supported Defi protocols with its corresponding data
 7. NFT - List of Top 100 NFT Sales and Collections
